# AndroidContactOrganizer
This is an application that is built for an Android device that stores important contact information.

## Getting Started 
To get started, first make a directory on your computer of where you want to put the projects from Github into. Then go in to projects directory and open Git Bash. Get the clone URL from Github's project repository and use git clone <URL> to clone the directory. Once you have the directory you can start working. 
    
## The Process of Using Git Commands
1. git pull - Pulls all new changes to a project. You want to do this before you start coding to make sure you have the most recent code.
2. git status - Shows all of the files that are being changed. 
3. git add - This adds files specified to be uploaded to the repo. (git add * - will add all files)
4. git commit -m "YOUR_MESSAGE_HERE" - When sent to repo, it is a short message that describes changes/additions to the project.
5. git push - This pushes the data up to the repo. First time, it will ask to provide a user and password for Github if I remember correctly.

## Other information
For instance I would code on both my laptop and desktop, then I would forget to pull data before I opened up Visual Studio when on other coding projects. Sometimes when trying to pull from the repo, it would say that file may need to be checkouted before pulling. Simply use git checkout <filename> to stop it from causing the error and allows the pull.
